## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
# Read the CSV file
df <- read.csv("Advertising-1.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# Fit a linear model with sales as the dependent variable and TV and radio as predictors
modell <- lm(sales ~ TV + radio, data = df)

# Create a new data frame for predictions
new_data <- data.frame(TV = 100, radio = 20)

# Make predictions with confidence interval
prediction <- predict(modell, newdata = new_data, interval = "confidence", level = 0.95)

# Make predictions with prediction interval
prediction_interval <- predict(modell, newdata = new_data, interval = "prediction", level = 0.95)

# Display the results
print(prediction)           # For confidence interval
print(prediction_interval)  # For prediction interval


```




### Confidence Interval (CI):
A Confidence Interval provides an estimate of the average response (\(\hat{y}\)) for specified values of the independent variables, like advertising spend on TV and radio. This estimate indicates how much we expect the average sales to be, with a reduced error margin.

### Prediction Interval (PI):
In contrast, a Prediction Interval forecasts individual responses based on given values of the independent variables. It indicates the potential variability in sales for a specific instance of spending on advertising.

### a) What is the average sales when $100,000 is spent on TV advertising and $20,000 on radio advertising?
The average sales resulting from the defined expenditure on TV and radio advertising can be obtained from the CI, which yields a value of **11.25647**.

### b) What is the predicted sales for a specific market when $100,000 is spent on TV advertising and $20,000 on radio advertising?
The sales prediction for the specified advertising investment is reflected in the PI, which also indicates a value of **11.25647**.

### c) Construct a 95% confidence interval for estimating the average sales under the same advertising expenditures as in (a) and (b).
For constructing a 95% confidence interval to estimate average sales, we refer to the CI bounds: **[10.98525, 11.52768]**.

### d) Construct a 95% prediction interval for predicting the sales of a specific market under the same advertising expenditures as in (a) and (b).
The 95% prediction interval for estimating sales in a particular market based on the same advertising expenses is given by the PI bounds: **[7.9296, 14.5833]**.
