# 🚀 Dive Into Regression – Beyond Y = mx + c! 🎯

## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository documents my journey through Math564 at IIT Chicago, where I discovered a new perspective on regression. Regression is a powerful tool that goes far beyond the simple linear equation Y = mx + c.

### What Regression Can Do:

- 📊 Select the most important features in your data
- 🔍 Reveal the underlying distribution of your variables
- 🎯 Explain which features contribute most to the variance in the target variable

## 📚 Repository Contents

- Assignments
- Supporting code
- Detailed inferences
- Key conclusions

This comprehensive resource is suitable for anyone eager to learn regression, from basic to advanced techniques.

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Whether you're a beginner or someone looking to deepen their understanding of machine learning, this repository offers valuable insights. Explore regression models that go beyond the basics and learn how they can help you make sense of data in ways you never thought possible.

## 📥 How to Use This Repo

Feel free to explore the content and learn at your own pace! This repository is ideal for:
- Working on feature selection
- Analyzing data distributions
- Discovering which features drive the most variance in your target variable
